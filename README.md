Algorithms for classifing/clustering data


# 1. K-means for clustering
K-means clustering aims to partition data into k clusters in a way that data points in the same cluster are similar and data points in the different clusters are farther apart.


# 2. SVM for classification
# 3. Decision-Tree for classification
# 4. Random-Forest for classification
