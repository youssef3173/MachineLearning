Algorithms for classifing/clustering data


# 1. K-means for clustering
K-means clustering aims to partition data into k clusters in a way that data points in the same cluster are similar and data points in the different clusters are farther apart.

# 2. SVM for classification
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.

# 3. Decision-Tree for classification
A decision tree is simply a set of cascading questions. When you get a data point (i.e. set of features and values), you use each attribute (i.e. a value of a given feature of the data point) to answer a question. The answer to each question decides the next question. At the end of this sequence of questions, you will end up with a probability of the data point belonging to each class.

# 4. Random-Forest for classification
Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification.
